## How to use
### Installation
This plugin has been added to the community plugin browser in Obsidian. You can get it from there.

#### Manual Installation
*Please note that these steps are not necessary anymore. You can get the plugin from the community plugin browser. Just install from there and jump to Setup.*

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/chhoumann/notetweet_obsidian/releases) and download the ZIP file from the latest release.
2. This ZIP file should be extracted in your Obsidian plugins folder. If you don't know where that is, you can go to `Community Plugins` inside Obsidian. There is a folder icon on the right of `Installed Plugins`. Click that and it opens your plugins folder.
3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file there.
4. Proceed to Setup

#### Setup
1. Go to https://apps.twitter.com/app/new and create a new app. Make sure it is Read + Write (otherwise you can't tweet).
2. Get your API key & secret and access token & secret.
3. Paste those into the plugin settings.

You'll see an indicator which tells you if you're connected or not.

## Post Tweet Mode
Using the `Post Tweet` command, a new modal will open. There, you can craft threads - or single tweets.
You can select both text or threads before using the command and it'll automatically port it into the modal. If the selected text is longer than 280 characters, it'll break it into a thread for you.
You can paste text into the modal. If that text is longer than 280 characters, it'll also break it into multiple tweets.

### Post Tweet Mode Shortcuts
- `Backspace` to delete empty tweet
- `Enter` to make new tweet if max length
- `Alt + Enter` to make new tweet
- `Ctrl + Enter` to insert a tweet below
- `Shift + Enter` to insert a new tweet above
- `Ctrl + ArrowUp` to focus tweet above
- `Ctrl + ArrowDown` to focus tweet below
- `Ctrl + Shift + ArrowUp` to move tweet up
- `Ctrl + Shift + ArrowDown` to move tweet down

## Quick-posts
Single tweets are simple. Just select some text and use the `Post Selected as Tweet` command.

**Threads** have a specific format. First off, it only detects the first thread in any file.

Format:
```
THREAD START

Here you can type the first tweet in your thread.

Spacing is fine.

---
Separation between tweets is done using a newline and three dashes - just like you see above.

---
Enjoy!

THREAD END
```

Threads must start with `THREAD START` and end with `THREAD END`.
