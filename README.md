## How to use
### Setup
1. Go to https://apps.twitter.com/app/new and create a new app. Make sure it is Read + Write (otherwise you can't tweet).
2. Get your API key & secret and access token & secret.
3. Paste those into the plugin settings.

You'll see an indicator which tells you if you're connected or not.

### Tweeting
Single tweets are simple. Just select some text and use the `Post Selected as Tweet` command.

**Threads** have a specific format. First off, it only detects the first thread in any file.

Format:
```
THREAD START

Here you can type the first tweet in your thread.

Spacing is fine.

---
Separation between tweets is done using a newline and three dashes - just like you see above.

Enjoy!

THREAD END
```

Threads must start with `THREAD START` and end with `THREAD END`.
