# Setting up Twitter Scheduling
## Important!
You will be _self_ -hosting a Node.js Express server along with a Postgres database. 

I will show you how to do this for free.

I will provide you with an existing scheduler, which you can modify it or add improvements to as you please.
If you desire, you could also create it in any way you want - as long as the API endpoints match those set in NoteTweet (which isn't configurable right now; open an issue if you need something). 

This is the repository for the [scheduler](https://github.com/chhoumann/notetweet-scheduler).

## Guide
The first thing you will need to do is to deploy the scheduler server. To do so, first click the ``Deploy`` button.
